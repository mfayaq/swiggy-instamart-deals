### 🧠 Smart Duplicate & Spam Suppression

To prevent flooding your Telegram with repeated notifications:
- **09:01 AM IST (Morning Reset)**: Clears previous day tracking and sends the complete fresh morning deals catalog.
- **30-Minute Interval Runs (09:31 AM – 12:01 AM midnight IST)**:
  - **Identical price**: Suppressed (not re-sent).
  - **Price drops**: Alerted immediately (`PRICE_DROP`).
  - **New deals**: Alerted (`NEW_DEAL`).
  - **Restocked items**: Alerted when back in stock (`BACK_IN_STOCK`).
- **Silent Exit**: If no deals meet the threshold, the bot exits silently without sending empty messages.
- **Queue Staleness Guard**: Automatically drops runs if GitHub runner queues delay execution by >15 minutes past target slots (e.g. preventing delayed 1:20 AM alerts).
- **Auto-Retry on Server Busy**: If Swiggy is overloaded during peak sale drops (such as 12:00 AM midnight), workers automatically retry up to 3 times with a 75s buffer before giving up.

## 🚀 Setup Your Personal Deal Hunter Bot (100% Free on GitHub Actions)

Follow these simple steps to run your own 24/7 Deal Hunter bot for your local Swiggy Instamart pod.

### Step 1: Fork This Repository
Click the **Fork** button at the top-right corner of this GitHub repository to copy it into your own GitHub account.

---

### Step 2: Create Your Telegram Bot
1. Open Telegram and search for [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather).
2. Send `/newbot` and follow the prompts to choose a bot name and username (e.g. `MySwiggyDealsBot`).
3. BotFather will provide an **HTTP API Token** (e.g. `1234567890:ABCdefGHIjklMNOpqrSTUvwxYZ...`). Save this token — this is your `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`.
4. Now search for [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot) on Telegram, tap **Start**, and copy your numeric **Id** (e.g. `123456789`). This is your `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`.
   > *Tip: If you want alerts sent to a Telegram Channel, create a public or private channel, add your bot as an Admin, and use the Channel Username (e.g. `@MyDealsChannel`) or Channel ID as `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`.*

---

### Step 3: Find Your Swiggy Dark Store IDs
1. Go to **[swiggy.com/instamart](https://www.swiggy.com/instamart)** in your browser and ensure your delivery address is selected.
2. Click on **any category** (such as *Atta, Rice & Dal* or *Dairy, Bread & Eggs*).
3. Look at your browser address bar URL. It will look like this:
   ```
   https://www.swiggy.com/instamart/category-listing?storeId=138294&primaryStoreId=138294&secondaryStoreId=138295...
   ```
4. Extract the IDs from the URL:
   - `storeId` → **`SWIGGY_STORE_ID`** (e.g. `138294`)
   - `primaryStoreId` → **`SWIGGY_PRIMARY_STORE_ID`** (same as `storeId`)
   - `secondaryStoreId` → **`SWIGGY_SECONDARY_STORE_ID`** (if present in your URL; if not present, leave empty)

---

### Step 4: Configure GitHub Secrets
In your forked GitHub repository:
1. Navigate to **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**.
2. Click **New repository secret** for each variable below:

#### Required Secrets:
| Secret Name | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` | Token provided by @BotFather |
| `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` | Numeric Chat ID from @userinfobot (or channel username) |
| `SWIGGY_STORE_ID` | Your local store pod ID from Swiggy URL |
| `SWIGGY_PRIMARY_STORE_ID` | Same as `SWIGGY_STORE_ID` |

#### Optional Secrets:
| Secret Name | Default | Description |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| `SWIGGY_SECONDARY_STORE_ID` | *(empty)* | Secondary store fallback ID if present in URL |
| `FRESH_MIN_DISCOUNT` | `60` | Custom minimum % discount for Worker 1 (`fresh`) |
| `GROCERY_MIN_DISCOUNT` | `60` | Custom minimum % discount for Worker 2 (`grocery`) |
| `TREATS_MIN_DISCOUNT` | `70` | Custom minimum % discount for Worker 3 (`treats`) |

| `PERSONAL_MIN_DISCOUNT` | `70` | Custom minimum % discount for Worker 6 (`personalCare`) |
| `LIFESTYLE_MIN_DISCOUNT` | `85` | Custom minimum % discount for Worker 7 (`lifestyle`) |

---

### Step 5: Enable Workflows & Test
1. Go to the **Actions** tab in your forked repository.
2. GitHub automatically pauses scheduled workflows on newly forked repositories. Click the green button: **"I understand my workflows, go ahead and enable them"**.
3. Select **"Swiggy Instamart Keyword Deal Hunter"** from the left sidebar.
4. Click **Run workflow** → select `Skip top-of-hour wait sync (run immediately)` → Click **Run workflow**.
5. Within ~30 seconds, all 7 workers will execute in parallel and you will receive high-discount deals directly on Telegram!
6. From now on, GitHub Actions runs automatically **every 30 minutes** from **09:01 AM to 12:01 AM midnight IST**.
7. *(Recommended)* Ensure your repository's **Settings → Actions → General → Workflow permissions** is set to **"Read and write permissions"** so the built-in auto-retry companion workflow can automatically re-run any worker that encounters a temporary GitHub runner allocation glitch.

## 🛠️ Customization Guide

### 1. How to Adjust Discount Thresholds
You have 3 ways to customize discount thresholds:

- **Via GitHub Secrets (Recommended for Actions)**:
  Add any of the optional secrets listed above (e.g. `GROCERY_MIN_DISCOUNT = 50`) in GitHub Secrets.
- **Via Telegram Bot Commands (If running the interactive bot)**:
  Send commands directly to your bot:
  ```
  /setdiscount grocery 50     # Sets grocery worker to >= 50%
  /setdiscount fresh 55       # Sets fresh worker to >= 55%
  /setdiscount all 65         # Sets all workers to >= 65%
  /status                     # View current thresholds and store info
  ```
- **Via `swiggy-telegram-bot/config.json`**:
  Open `config.json` and change the `"minDiscount"` field inside any campaign:
  ```json
  "fresh": {
    "name": "Daily Fresh Produce & Meats",
    "minDiscount": 55
  }
  ```

---

### 2. How to Add or Remove Subcategories
All 327 subcategories are defined in [`swiggy-telegram-bot/config.json`](file:///d:/Projects/Swiggy/swiggy-telegram-bot/config.json).

To add an aisle to any worker:
1. Open `swiggy-telegram-bot/config.json`.
2. Locate the worker campaign (e.g. `fresh`, `grocery`, `treats`, etc.).
3. Add a new subcategory entry to its `subcategories` array:
   ```json
   {
     "category": "Fresh Fruits",
     "name": "Organic Apples",
     "id": "<sub_category_filter_id>",
     "taxonomyType": "Speciality taxonomy 1"
   }
   ```
4. Commit and push changes. Your GitHub Actions runners will automatically include the new subcategory on the next scan!

> [!TIP]
> **How to find the subcategory `id`**:
> Open DevTools (<kbd>F12</kbd>) → **Network** tab on Swiggy Instamart. When you click any subcategory filter, check the payload of the `category-listing/filter/v2` request for `filterId` and `categoryName`.
